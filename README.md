# Google Cloud Solutions Builder

**A solution framework to generate code with built-in structure and modules
to accelerate your project setup.**

## TL;DR

Solutions Builder is a boilerplate tool for building repeatable solutions with the
best practices in architecture on Google Cloud, including Cloud Run, GKE clusters,
Test Automation, CI/CD, etc, with built-in modules including:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) boilerplate modules
- Modular microservice templates, deployable to Cloud Run or a Kubernetes cluster.
- Generating code from templates at remote Git repo (e.g. a private Git repo)
- Container image building and deploying with [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev)
- Modules and templates based on [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- CI/CD deployment templates.

## Build a solution by adding modules

Solutions Builder is designed with modules and templates. When creating a new solution
folder, it starts from a base template with a terraform foundation and project skeleton.
Then, you can start adding modules into this solution folder.

For example, these are examples of creating a new solution:

- Start a new solution with a base (skeleton) code from a "root template"
- Add a Cloud Run microservice with APIs
- Add a Load Balancer with Identity-Aware Proxy
- Add CI/CD for deployment

## Install Solutions Builder CLI

```

```

## Quick Start - Create a new solution

> This quick start steps will create the following:
>
> - Create a new solution folder.
> - Create a new GCP project and initialize Terraform infrastructure.
> - Add a FastAPI-based microservice with a sample API.
> - Deploy the service to Cloud Run.

Generate a new solution in `my-solution-folder` folder.

```
sb new my-solution-folder
```

This will prompt options and variables:

```
ðŸŽ¤ What is your project name? (Spaces are allowed.)
   my awesome solution name
ðŸŽ¤ What is your Google Cloud project ID?
   my-project-id
ðŸŽ¤ Create GCP project 'my-project-id'? (yes/no)
   yes
ðŸŽ¤ Which Google Cloud region?
   us-central1
ðŸŽ¤ Default deploy method? (cloudrun or gke)
   Cloud Run

(...Leave the rest as default)
```

Once answered, it will generate the code from the template:

```
Copying from template
    create  .
    create  .pylintrc
    create  .copier-answers.yml
    ...
```

Answer questions when adding `terraform_base` module:

```
Adding module 'terraform_base'...
ðŸŽ¤ Use GCS Bucket for Terraform backend?
   Yes
ðŸŽ¤ What is your GCP billing account?
   12345-12345-12345
ðŸŽ¤ Use GCS Bucket for Terraform backend?
   Yes

Copying from template
 identical  .
    create  terraform
    create  terraform/stages
    ...


Complete. New solution folder created at ./my-solution-folder.
```

Add a Sample Cloud Run microservice using `blank_service` module template:

```
cd my-solution-folder
sb add component sample_service -t blank_service
```

- Alternatively, use a template from a remote Git repo like:
  ```
   sb add component sample_service -t git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-builder.git/modules/blank_service
  ```

And answer the following:

```
This will add component 'sample_service' to 'components' folder. Continue? [Y/n]:
ðŸŽ¤ Resource name (lower case, alphanumeric characters, '-')?
   sample-service
ðŸŽ¤ Which Google Cloud region?
   us-central1
ðŸŽ¤ Add a sample API?
   Yes
ðŸŽ¤ Does this component require the Common image?
   No
ðŸŽ¤ Default deploy method? (cloudrun or gke)
   Cloud Run
```

Apply all Terraform stages (in `terraform/stages` folder)

```
sb terraform apply --all --yes
```

The command above will run the following:

- Init and apply all Terraform stages. (`terraform init` and `terraform apply`))
- Build the sample_service container image and published to Artifact Registry. (using [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev))
- Deploy the sample_service container to Cloud Run. (using Terraform)

> Optionally, manually build and deploy sample_service using `sb deploy`.
>
> ```
> sb deploy -m sample_service
> ```

Once deployed, you can test the Cloud Run instance at:
https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/us-central1/sample-service
