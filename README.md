# Google Cloud Solutions Builder

**A solution framework to generate a new project with built-in structure and modules
to accelerate your project setup.**

## TL;DR

Solutions Builder is a boilerplate template for building repeatable
solutions with the best practices in architecture on Google Cloud, including GKE
clusters, Cloud Run, Test Automation, CI/CD, as well as development process.

This template provides built-in and ready-to-ship modules including:
* Easy-to-deploy [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) boilerplate modules
* Container-based microservices, can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster or Cloud Run.
* Unified deployment using Skaffold.
* Automatically generated API documentation with Swagger UI.
* CI/CD deployment (with GitHub Actions).
* Cloud Run templates.

## Installing Solutions Builder CLI

With `pip`:
```
pip install solutions-builder
```

With `pipx`:
```
pip install --user pipx
pipx install solutions-builder
```

## Quick Start

This quick start steps will do the following:
- Create a new GCP project and initialize Cloud foundation.
- Add a RESTful API service for managing Todo list.
- Deploy the service to Cloud Run.

Set up GCP project
```
export PROJECT_ID=my-solution-gcp-id

# (Optional) Create a new GCP project. You can also use an existing GCP project.
gcloud projects create $PROJECT_ID

# Set gcloud CLI to the GCP project.
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

Generate a new solution folder.
```
sb new my-solution
```

This will prompt options and variables:
```
ðŸŽ¤ What is your project name? (Spaces are allowed.)
   my-solution
ðŸŽ¤ What is your Google Cloud project ID?
   my-solution-gcp-id
ðŸŽ¤ What is your Google Cloud project number?
   12345678
ðŸŽ¤ Which Google Cloud region?
   us-central1
ðŸŽ¤ Use GCS Bucket for Terraform backend?
   Yes
```

Go to the newly created project folder
```
cd my-solution
sb infra apply 1-bootstrap
```

Initialize Cloud infrastructure
- Option 1: (Recommended) Log in to the jump host and run the following command(s) in the solution folder.
- Option 2: Run the following commands in your local machine.
```
sb infra apply 2-foundation
```

Add a RESTful API service with **Todo** data model to this solution.
```
sb components add restful_service
```

Fill details in the prompt:
- Component name: **todo_service**
- Resource name: **todo-service**
- Relative path: **todo-service**
- GCP region: **us-central1**
- Data model name: **todo**
- Add Cloud Run to deployment methods: **yes**
- Create network endpoint group (NEG) for serverless ingress: **yes**
- Default deploy method? (cloudrun or gke): **Cloud Run**

Add an HTTP Load Balancer for Cloud Run service(s)
```
sb add component terraform_httplb_cloudrun
sb infra apply 3-httplb-cloudrun
```

Build and deploy
```
sb deploy
```
- See other deployment options in [solutions_builder/modules](solutions_builder/modules).
