# Google Cloud Solutions Template

**A solution framework to generate a new project with built-in structure and modules
to accelerate your project setup.**

## TL;DR

Solutions Template is a boilerplate template for building repeatable
solutions with the best practices in architecture on Google Cloud, including GKE
clusters, Cloud Run, Test Automation, CI/CD, as well as development process.

This template provides built-in and ready-to-ship modules including:
* Easy-to-deploy [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) boilerplate modules
* Container-based microservices, can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster or Cloud Run.
* Unified deployment using Skaffold.
* Automatically generated API documentation with Swagger UI.
* CI/CD deployment (with Github Actions).
* Cloud Run templates.

## Installing Solutions Template CLI

```
pipx install solutions-template
```

## Getting Started

Generate a new solution folder.
```
st new my-solution .
```

This will prompt options and variables:
```
ðŸŽ¤ What is your project name? (Spaces are allowed.)
   my-solutions
ðŸŽ¤ What is your Google Cloud project ID?
   my-solutions
ðŸŽ¤ What is your Google Cloud project number?
   12345678
ðŸŽ¤ Which Google Cloud region?
   us-central1
ðŸŽ¤ Use GCS Bucket for Terraform backend?
   Yes
```

Go to the newly created project folder and initialize the solution.
```
cd my-solution
st init
```

Add a RESTful API component with **Todo** data model to this solution.
```
st component add restful_service
```

Fill details in the prompt:
- Component name: **todo_service**
- Resource name: **todo-service**
- Relative path: **todo-service**
- GCP region: **us-central1**
- Data model name: **todo**
- Add Cloud Run to deployment methods: **yes**
- Create network endpoint group (NEG) for serverless ingress: **yes**
- Default deploy method? (cloudrun or gke): **Cloud Run**

Add a HTTP Load Balancer for Cloud Run service(s)
```
st add component terraform_httplb_cloudrun
st init --stage=3-httplb-cloudrun
```

Build and deploy
```
st deploy
```
