# Google Cloud Solutions Builder

**A solution framework to generate code with built-in structure and modules
to accelerate your project setup.**

## TL;DR

Solutions Builder is a boilerplate tool for building repeatable solutions with the
best practices in architecture on Google Cloud, including Cloud Run, GKE clusters,
Test Automation, CI/CD, etc.

Solutions Builder provides built-in and ready-to-ship modules including:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) boilerplate modules
- Modular microservice templates, deployable to Cloud Run or a Kubernetes cluster.
- Support using templates from remote Git repo (e.g. a private Git repo)
- Unified deployment using Skaffold.
- Auto-generated OpenAPI schema with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
- CI/CD deployment templates.

## Install Solutions Builder CLI

With `pip`:

```
pip install solutions-builder
```

With `pipx`:

```
pip install --user pipx && pipx install solutions-builder
```

## Quick Start - Create a new solution

> This quick start steps will create the following:
>
> - Create a new solution folder.
> - Create a new GCP project and initialize Terraform infrastructure.
> - Add a FastAPI-based microservice with a sample API.
> - Deploy the service to Cloud Run.

Generate a new solution in `my-solution-folder` folder.

```
sb new my-solution-folder
```

This will prompt options and variables:

```
ðŸŽ¤ What is your project name? (Spaces are allowed.)
   my awesome solution name
ðŸŽ¤ What is your Google Cloud project ID?
   my-project-id
ðŸŽ¤ Create GCP project 'my-project-id'? (yes/no)
   yes
ðŸŽ¤ Which Google Cloud region?
   us-central1
ðŸŽ¤ Default deploy method? (cloudrun or gke)
   Cloud Run

(...Leave the rest as default)
```

Once answered, it will generate the code from the template:

```
Copying from template
    create  .
    create  .pylintrc
    create  .copier-answers.yml
    ...
```

Answer questions when adding `terraform_base` module:

```
Adding module 'terraform_base'...
ðŸŽ¤ Use GCS Bucket for Terraform backend?
   Yes

Copying from template
 identical  .
    create  terraform
    create  terraform/stages
    ...


Complete. New solution folder created at ./my-solution-folder.
```

Add a Sample Cloud Run microservice using `blank_service` module template:

```
cd my-solution-folder
sb add component sample_service -t blank_service
```

- Alternatively, use a template from a remote Git repo like:
  ```
   sb add component sample_service -t git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-builder.git/modules/blank_service
  ```

And answer the following:

```
This will add component 'sample_service' to 'components' folder. Continue? [Y/n]:
ðŸŽ¤ Resource name (lower case, alphanumeric characters, '-')?
   sample-service
ðŸŽ¤ Which Google Cloud region?
   us-central1
ðŸŽ¤ Add a sample API?
   Yes
ðŸŽ¤ Does this component require the Common image?
   No
ðŸŽ¤ Default deploy method? (cloudrun or gke)
   Cloud Run
```

Initialize Terraform

```
sb terraform apply --all --yes
```

- This will initialize all Terraform stages.
- Build and deploy the sample service to Cloud Run.

Alternatively, build and deploy all components:

```
sb deploy
```
