# Cloud Run developmnet

## Deployment

In this Solutions Template, we use [`skaffold`](https://skaffold.dev/) to deploy for both backend microservices and frontend application. The same steps apply for deploying to GKE and Cloud Run.

### Deploy to Cloud Run with default **run.app** domain

Run the following to deploy Cloud Run with default Cloud Run URL:
```
export PROJECT_ID=<my-gcp-project-id>
export SERVICE_NAME=<service-name> # e.g. sample-service or frontend-angular

skaffold run -p cloudrun --default-repo=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID -m $SERVICE_NAME
```

Once deployed, you will see the output like below:
```
Starting deploy...
 - configmap/env-vars-<hash> created
 - service/frontend-angular created
 - deployment.apps/frontend-angular created
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
 - deployment/frontend-angular is ready.
Deployments stabilized in 1.932 second
You can also run [skaffold run --tail] to get the logs
```

Display the URL for the deployed Cloud Run services:
```
gcloud run services describe $SERVICE_NAME --region=$REGION
```
- This will display the following output:
  ```
  âœ” Service frontend-angular in region us-central1
  run-id:<id-hash>
  URL:     https://frontend-angular-<random-hash>.a.run.app
  Ingress: all
  Traffic:
    100% LATEST (currently frontend-angular-<hash>)
  ```

Open up the URL in a browser to check out the frontend app.

> By default, Cloud Run services require authentication (e.g. Service Account) to access the services. To allow all web users to access the frontend application, check out the following section to allow public access.

To deploy a service to Cloud Run, specify the `cloudrun` profile in Skaffold command as below:
```
skaffold run -p cloudrun --default-repo=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID -m $SERVICE_NAME
```
- This will deploy the `$SERVICE_NAME` service to Cloud Run and generate a service with default **run.app** URL.

See the following sections for other use cases.

### Deploy with live-reload for debugging

Run the following to build and deploy to Cloud Run with port forwarding to test via localhost:

```
export REGION=us-central1
skaffold dev -p cloudrun --default-repo=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID -m $SERVICE_NAME --port-forward
```

Once deployed, you will see the output like below:
```
frontend-angular: Service starting: Deploying Revision. Waiting on revision frontend-angular-kmwth.
Cloud Run Service frontend-angular finished: Service started. 0/1 deployment(s) still pending
Forwarding service projects/solutions-template-develop/locations/us-central1/services/frontend-angular to local port 9001
Listing files to watch...
- frontend-angular
Press Ctrl+C to exit
Watching for changes...
```

Open the link http://127.0.0.1:9001 or http://localhost:9001 in a browser to see the service.
- If you are deploying the microservice, open http://localhost:9001/sample_service/docs for the API swagger documentation.
- At this point, every changes in local files will trigger files hot-swap and update to the remote instance automatically. See [Skaffold File Sync](https://skaffold.dev/docs/pipeline-stages/filesync/) for more details.
- When clicked Ctrl+C, it will remove the Cloud Run service.


### Allowing public (unauthenticated) access to a Cloud Run service

You can allow unauthenticated access to either the microservice or the frontend application.

Run the following commands to update Organization policies:
```
export ORGANIZATION_ID=$(gcloud organizations list --format="value(name)" | head -n 1)
gcloud resource-manager org-policies delete constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains --organization=$ORGANIZATION_ID
```

Re-login to gcloud to refresh the auth:
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Run the following to allow unauthenticated users:
```
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding $SERVICE_NAME \
--region="$REGION" \
--member="allUsers" \
--role="roles/run.invoker"
```
